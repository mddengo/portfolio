In the spring semester of 2017 I took a course called "Communication Design Fundamentals," where I learned the basics of communication design and how to communicate my ideas through typography, graphics, layout, etc.

Over the course of the semester we had four major projects to turn in.

In the [first project](https://medium.com/communication-design-fundamentals-spring-2017/project-2-complete-documentation-2ac8828701ea), we explored the concept of conveying simple descriptive words using only squares and a single color.

For the [second project](https://medium.com/communication-design-fundamentals-spring-2017/project-3-complete-documentation-1542e6be6a9b), we learned about typography and how to communicate ideas using type. We were tasked with creating a poster focusing on a specific typeface.

The [third project](https://medium.com/communication-design-fundamentals-spring-2017/project-4-complete-documentation-4b6f4332e7b8) combined what we'd learned through the creation of three posters designed to advertise a festival of our choosing.

The class culminated in the [final project](https://medium.com/communication-design-fundamentals-spring-2017/project-5-complete-documentation-a137c6dca6b): a visual book of our own ideation and creation.
